	/// PriorityQueue provides a stack-like interface, except that objects

	/// from least to greatest as defined by the specified comparer.
	/// </summary>

	/// Push and Pop are each O(log N). Pushing N objects and them popping
	/// them all is equivalent to performing a heap sort and is O(N log N).
	/// </remarks>

		// The _heap array represents a binary tree with the "shape" property.
		// If we number the nodes of a binary tree from left-to-right and top-
		// to-bottom as shown,
		//
		//             0
		//           /   \
		//          /     \
		//         1       2

		//      3    4   5   6
		//     /\    /
		//    7  8  9
		//
		// The shape property means that there are no gaps in the sequence of
		// numbered nodes, i.e., for all N > 0, if node N exists then node N-1
		// also exists. For example, the next node added to the above tree would
		// be node 10, the right child of node 4.
		//
		// Because of this constraint, we can easily represent the "tree" as an
		// array, where node number == array index, and parent/child relationships
		// can be calculated instead of maintained explicitly. For example, for
		// any node N > 0, the parent of N is at array index (N - 1) / 2.
		//
		// In addition to the above, the first _count members of the _heap array
		// compose a "heap", meaning each child node is greater than or equal to
		// its parent node; thus, the root node is always the minimum (i.e., the
		// best match for the specified style, weight, and stretch) of the nodes
		// in the heap.
		//
		// Initially _count < 0, which means we have not yet constructed the heap.
		// On the first call to MoveNext, we construct the heap by "pushing" all
		// the nodes into it. Each successive call "pops" a node off the heap
		// until the heap is empty (_count == 0), at which time we've reached the
		// end of the sequence.
